# Symmies-ATK-UI
An simple ui extension for the Asobo-Tool-Kit by widberg

# IMPORTANT:
If want to close the programm, close the game first, then the "Symmies ATK UI" then the console.
If you don't, dead processes will stack up, that you need to clear of manually in the task manager.

To start, doubleclick the start.bat
It's recommended to have the Gamefolder and the Asobo Toolk Kit and This program folder in the same directory.

-game *game.exe (change to what your game.exe is called.)

-hook (Enables Game hooking, instead of Starting the game itself)

-up (Goes with the working directory one up;)

-chdir *path (Change Working Directory, so that the programm can find the executables and other dependencies.)
